# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It can teach aspiring web developers of all ages and skill ranges about the basics of coding as a web developer. This guide is a useful tool to look back through and search for important topics.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. To run JavaScript tools we open the DevTools console. In the Devtools console, we can see the console logs we made in the script.js file. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
